# Online-3D-Fighting-Game

Reflecting on the project, it achieved what the main plan was for the project, to create a multiplayer online combat game. It was challenging at first to know where to start with Photon Unity Networking. The hardest part was learning to synchronise lots of variables over the network. 

	The preset Viking asset package comes along with a prefab character and animations. This character was going to be used but new animations needed to be added for combat so instead it was better to download a new character pack with fighting animations from the asset store. The original camera follow that came with the Viking pack was also going to be used but it was better for a mouse orbit style camera to be used to aim better during combat.
  
The things that could be improved upon based on the personal knowledge from playing, observing others and from questionnaires would be to improve the UI so that it is more consistent and clear to the audience. The game could be clearer on the objective by writing it somewhere at the beginning of the game. Players could have more fun and feel more immersed in the game if it there were more sounds and events that happened to make the player feel like they have really struck the other player.
